# raylib_tetris
Rudimentary creation of tetris using Raylib.

I recently gave myself the task of creating a tetris clone using the amazing Raylib library. Hopefully I haven't offended anyone with this abomination..

Feel free to poke around, edit, improve, say *tut tut and generally balk at the quality of this monstrosity.. as I'm new to many of the tools used and just proud of the fact I got it half way there.

# Points to note
* Scoring system needs including
* Some sort of level system
* Game over/options screen/pause
