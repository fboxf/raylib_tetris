# raylib_tetris
Tetris clone using Raylib.

I recently gave myself the task of creating a tetris clone using the amazing Raylib library. Hopefully I haven't offended anyone with this abomination..

Feel free to (please!) poke around, edit, improve, say *tut tut and generally balk at the quality of this monstrosity.. I'm new to many of the tools used and proud of the fact I got my first project working.

# Points to note
* Download files into one folder and simply run ./make (assume you have make installed)
  * Left Arrow - Left, Right Arrow - Right, Up Arrow - Change rotation
  * Down Arrow - To be completed (move item down);
* Tested on linux only
* Scoring system needs including 
* Some sort of level system required (currently just amending FramesCounter)
* Game over/options screen/pause not yet implemented
