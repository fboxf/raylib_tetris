# raylib_tetris
Rudimentary creation of tetris using Raylib.

I recently gave myself the task of creating a tetris clone using the amazing Raylib library. 

Feel free to poke around, edit, improve, say *tut tut and generally balk at the quality of this monstrosity.. as I'm new to many of the tools used and just proud of the fact I got it half way there :-)
